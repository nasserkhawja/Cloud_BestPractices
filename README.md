Cloud best practices template and scripts

Access Management
Principle of Least Privilege: Grant users and services the minimum permissions necessary.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all users, especially for administrative roles.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to manage user permissions based on roles.

Network Security
Network Segmentation: Use Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and subnets to segment network traffic and minimize exposure.
Security Groups and Firewalls: Configure security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Private Endpoints: Use private endpoints to securely connect to cloud services without exposing them to the public internet.

Data Protection
Encryption: Encrypt data at rest and in transit using strong encryption standards.
Key Management: Use cloud-native key management services (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault) to manage encryption keys.
Backup and Recovery: Implement regular backups and test recovery processes to ensure data integrity and availability.

Monitoring and Logging
Enable Logging: Ensure logging is enabled for all services and resources. Use services like AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Logging.
Centralized Log Management: Aggregate logs in a central location for analysis and long-term storage.
Alerts and Notifications: Set up alerts for suspicious activities or deviations from normal behavior.
